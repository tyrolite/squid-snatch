Network packet analyzer

  This was my practical application for diploma thesis(Bachelor Degree). 

  The program is similar to the well-known Wireshark, but only the basic
packet capturing feature is implemented.The format of headers or datagrams
are stored in XML files.

Dependencies:

Qt - for graphical user interface(there is no CLI)
libpcap - for packet capturing
